**Restaurant Order Management**: 

In this example, we have classes for **Order** and **OrderManager**. The **Order** class represents an individual order with properties such as *OrderId*, *CustomerName*, *Items* (a list of items in the order), and *Status* (an enum indicating the order's status). The **OrderManager** class handles the management of orders, including placing orders, updating order status, and displaying order details.

In the **Main** method, we create an instance of **OrderManager** and demonstrate the usage by placing orders, updating the status of an order, and displaying order details.

*Please note that this is a simplified example to demonstrate the concept, and in a real-world scenario, you may want to add more error handling, validation, and additional functionality based on the requirements of the challenge*.
